### Modified FREENFET3 ###

We bought a couple OF Freetronic's FREENFET3 from robotshop but it did not satisfy our electronics connector workflow.
This board is based on the FREENFET3 but offers:
- Four M3 mounting holes
- 3.96mm pitch footprints with a source and drain for each output
-- you can mount screw terminals or MTA-156 connectors or anything else 3.96mm pitch
- 2.54mm pitch for 5v data ground
- power on LED
